# iOS-Demo-Project

Hello!

Following tasks were performed as part of the interview assignment by Bayut and Dubbizle:

1. Performed a task to fetch data from the API and populated it in custom cells in TableView. 
2. Performed a task to navigate to the controller with detail of every product on click of each cell of TableView. (Capability to view and also pop back to home screen)
3. Performed the task to set Autolayout on both screens as well as the custom cell of Table View. 
4. MVVM Architecture is followed in this assignment
5. Followed SOLID architectural principle as best as it could have been followed since the module was small and made sure that there were no violations of SOLID principle rules. Made sure to not violate single principle, open-close principle, and liskov substitution principle. 
6. Since I was asked to make the final build of this assigned application, I added a few valuable features to make it a more user friendly look and feel. For instance, I added an 'Internet Connectivity Check' for testing the connectivity of the user and a 'Loading Animation' to cover the wait time for the data load. 
7. Perfromed the task of writing unit tests for both 'success' and 'fail' scenarios. 
8. Since the assigned application had a single module, there was minimal scope for integration testing. However, in order to fulfill the assigned requirements, I compiled a set of scenarios and wrote them in TestClass. 
9. Performed the task of writing UI tests for TableView, TableView swipe, and the buttons. 
10. The app is compiled on XCode 12 as per the assinged requirements.
11. This project can be modified anytime since it follows the Open Close principle. (i.e Open for Extension, Closed for Modification)
12. Every method, class, and variable is well documented and indicates the purpose as well as the responsibility within the application. 


I hope this covers all the requested tasks. Thanks for the opportunity and looking forward to next steps. 

Regards,
Ahmer Hassan
